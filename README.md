# ML-Projects
The project is from a Python Bootcamp held by ShapeAI.
Here, we have used KNN to classify the given problem. 
We have used the dataset available in sklearn named Iris Dataset.
The file named Final is a sub part of my academic year project where we tried to make predictive model for detection of PCOS, it's ongoing so changes mightbe made later on.
